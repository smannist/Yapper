| 31-12-2025 |   3   | Finished workflows for Azure Functions deployment. Set up Web App in Azure Portal for frontend. Setup workflows for frontend. Battled with website visibility issues, found out it was related to start up command in Azure, solved those.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Tomorrow start working on authentication.

| 25-01-2025 |   4   | Decided to start working on the frontend instead of figuring out auth before I have some components ready. Added basic nav menu components and hamburger menu + header collapsing for smaller screens, so it's a bit more responsive. Fixed credential issue on Azure side after repo name change. Implemented dark mode.                                                                                                                                                            | Next probably work on the main content component. Research into how to reduce this crazy inline bloat cause by tailwind.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 26-01-2025 |   1   | I got stuck in styling rabbit hole: changed icons for switching themes and created an animation with view transition api.

| 27-01-2025 |  2.5  | Did a mega refactor since code was becoming spaghetti.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Work on the content component now, make some mock data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 28-01-2025 |  2.5  | Organized tailwind themes and separated into files. Refactored inlines into consts that should be more readable. Cn function for tailwind management. New folder structure.

Continue on frontend? See how to setup Azure SQL DB?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 31-01-2025 |  4.5  | Setup Azure SQL Database. Removed hardcoded mock data and moved it to the db. Setup all the things needed to establish a connection: drizzle and azure functions. Used tanstack query for frontend cause I like the simplicity. Did all the devops stuff on Azure Portal: confs, envs. Some refactoring.                                                                                                                                                                             | Setup auth. After some research, Easy Auth seems to be best suited for external identity providers (like Google). So, probably need to add Entra. I could go with classic JTW, but I would rather use this time to learn something new. On the frontend, I still need to build the login and create account UI components. |
| 01-02-2025 |  3.5  | Migrated to Azure DB for PostgreSQL instead. Mainly because: 1. I like it and it has good support for JSON in case I wanna do that, 2. Flexible is cheaper than any Azure SQL DB plan which doesn't have massive cold starts, 3. Drizzle has much better support for PostgreSQL while their mysql support is pretty much in beta. Took much longer than I wanted due to lingering global psql conf issues. Some refactoring and figuring out cleaner ways so stuff is more testable. | Same as above. Gonna continue from this tomorrow.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
