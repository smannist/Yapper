| 31-01-2025 |  4.5   | Setup Azure SQL Database. Removed hardcoded mock data and moved it to the db. Setup all the things needed to establish a connection: drizzle and azure functions. Used tanstack query for frontend cause I like the simplicity.

After some research, Easy Auth seems to be best suited for external identity providers (like Google). So, probably need to add Entra. I could go with classic JTW, but I would rather use this time to learn something new. On the frontend, I still need to build the login and create account UI components. |
| 01-02-2025 |  3.5   | Migrated to Azure DB for PostgreSQL instead. Mainly because: 1. I like it and it has good support for JSON in case I wanna do that, 2. Flexible is cheaper than any Azure SQL DB plan which doesn't have massive cold starts, 3. Drizzle has much better support for PostgreSQL while their MSSQL support is pretty much in beta. Took much longer than I wanted due to lingering global psql conf issues. Some refactoring and figuring out cleaner ways so stuff is more testable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Same as above.

| 04-02-2025 |  5.5   | Looked into Microsoft External Entra ID and how to implement it only to find out that I can't even add external tenants due to being on student plan. I was going to upgrade the plan, but that would also invalidate all the free credits - so opted to just make token auth on my own. On the flipside, I also learned that the other method (Microsoft one) uses token auth regardless, so it would have been same idea, but I would not have had to save and hash passwords. Implemented auth + create user / posts + login. All of this works, but it's not really code I would like to push into git, yet, since a lot could be simplified (e.g. I found out that Drizzle combines well with zod, so working on simplifying that kinda logic). | Refactor current code -> then push to git.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 05-02-2025 |  2.5   | Finished yesterday's work. There is still some stuff that clearly needs cleaner structure, especially on schema folders. The schema's itself might still need adjustments.
