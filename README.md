# Y

The goal of the project is to build a similar social media platform to X.

Rough tech stack:

- Frontend
  - TypeScript with React
- Backend
  - Azure App Service / Functions
- Database
  - TBD but toss up between Azure SQL Database and Azure Cosmos DB or a combination of these two

Currently only basic 'hello world' demo is hosted. This was mainly done to make sure deployment to Azure is working correctly. You can find this at:
